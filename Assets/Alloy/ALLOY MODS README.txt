Alloy Mods

This folder contains a collection of beta shaders, experiments, and one-off's we've done for personal work. 

They are NOT officially supported, not documented (though I'll probably show them off in a vid from time to time). HOWEVER, if you play around with them, and find them truly useful, do feel free to let me know on twitter (@AntonHand), and if enough folk dig a specific shader, we'll consider adding it into the core.
